# ddd domain driven design
In the first place, I must address the pros and cons of a conventional architecture. Among the pros, we have queries to the database in a faster way, since the architecture is developed from the data and not in the logic or behavior that these will have as main idea so that in the short term its development will be in less time, but adding functionalities in the long term can be an exponential graph, having said that I will go into the domain Driven design or ddd, which insists on the business rules as the main entity taking Taking into account concepts such as ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, data mapping, ddd is an evolution of the architecture in 3 layers, presentation layer (api), application (use cases) this layer interacts with the domain layer (it has all the logic of the app and is as isolated as possible), the infrastructure layer that has login, data access and framework here we have persistence and we can use mappers like entityframework, this is u A simple example to practice these concepts
